#About the project

## Some libraries used


* **Data Binding** -> Used because it greatly simplifies adding and handling content in the layout.
* **Jetpack Navigation** -> Used because it facilitates navigation between fragments.
* **Flow** -> Facilitates communication with the repository and the api.
* **Dagger Hilt** ->  The main benefit for this project was to allow tests running on android to be more easily manipulated.


## Architecture used for this project


MVVM - Livedata -> I believe it to be satisfactory for many cases.
